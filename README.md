# Simple-Directory-Lister
Very simple and lightweight directory listing script.

# What it does
Nothing useful actually.
Just lists the files in the directory it is running from
and can browse through child directories.
No fancy breadcrumb or other visual effects.
Use your browser navigation buttons to navigate

# Installation
No installation required.
But you could filter out some files or file extensions if you'd like
from the configuration portion of the script.

# Credits
The HTML and CSS and JS was mostly copied from W3Schools.com. I made slight changes to meet my needs.
